# Big Question: Should Microsoft create a new movie studio, and if so what is the recommended film production strategy?

<ul>
    <li>Which production companies have been the most successful of recent?</li>
    <li>What's the correlation between popularity score and gross income for films?</li>
    <li>How can the global economy / a global potential user base be well-incorporated into Microsoft's plans?</li>
    <li>Is there data to support a new movie studio launch in a particular niche?</li>
</ul>


# Process & (Data Science) Tools Used

<ul>
    <li>Scraped data from TMDb via API, using TMDb Wrapper</li>
    <li>Researched the length of time it takes to go from movie announcement to release date</li>
    <li>Queried the <i>movies.Popular</i> filter to obtain 1000/3000 movie IDs that were then used to pull data from the <i>movies.Info</i>database</li>
    <li>Created dataframes specific to the questions I posed</li>
    <li>Leveraged the following tools: Pandas, FuncFormatter, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Squarify</li>
    <li>Used <b>Budget</b> and <b>Revenue</b> to create a new column: Gross Income</li>
    <li>Created visualizations to gain insights into the data</li>
    <li><b>Focused largely on films released in the last 36 months</b></li>
